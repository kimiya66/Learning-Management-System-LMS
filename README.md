# Learning-Management-System-LMS
- A Java-based Project for learning management system.
-Developed using Java 17, with DBMS and SQLite utilized for database management.
- I used in this project 3 types of design patterns:
    - Singleton: To have only one instance from each management class
    - Strategy Pattern: To implement the filter functionality on courses
    - Observer pattern: to define cached data for continuous access to courses, minimizing database calls by keeping the cache updated whenever course data changes.
# Remaining Steps and Tasks to be completed:
1. The GUI part is not written yet and I just have a simple main class to test the functionality via console. But JavaFX will be used as a GUI and I am stil working on that.
2. Junit Tests should be completed.
3. I want to change the project to a SpringBoot project and add RestAPI functionalities by using Spring.
